# used_car_management_2020
Update on my previous class project from 2019. 

Updates:
1) Used more prepared (or prepared-like) statements when querying from the database
2) Updated CSS, and used responsive design columns for better look 
3) Updated files and folders to delineate separation of priviliges between admin and members
